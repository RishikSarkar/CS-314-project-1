LIST OF TEST CASES FOR OPTIMIZATION PASSES
03/26/2023


Here are 15 ILOC test programs for project 1.

All your passes should run correctly on these 15 test cases. If there is no opportunity for optimization,
no optimization should be performed. 

Here is a list of test cases with optimization opportunities for the three different passes.

Strength reduction:
test0.out, test3.out, test8.out, test9.out, test10.out, test12.out, test14.out

Constant folding:
test3.out, test4.out, test5.out, test8.out, test11.out, test14.out

Dead code elimination:
test0.out, test3.out, test4.out, test5.out, test6.out, test8.out, test10.out, test13.out


Note: (1) test13.out is test11.out after constant folding
      (2) test14.out requires input on command line: sim -i 1024 VALUE < test14.out
      (3) The simulator "sim" uses out-of-order execution, so you cannot only rely on the reported
          execution cycles to see whether your optimization was successful. You should inspect your
	  unoptimized and optimized code.
